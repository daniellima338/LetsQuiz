### **Design Choices**

<a></a>

#### **Fonts**
 I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options. The fonts used in this project are [Raleway] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) for the overall text and [Fira Sans] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans#standard-styles) for the headlines. The fonts have a light readthrough and do not come of as strong to the eye. It goes well in line with the hip and light design of the website. 

<a></a>

#### **Icons**
I have used icons from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). The icons fit with the corresponding features that the users of the website are to understand. The visual aspect will make it easier to make a fast intepretation of what the text is about.


<a></a>

#### **Colors**


You can view my color scheme [here](assets/images/colors.png)

![Color Scheme](assets/images/colors.png)

The colors are inspired by the colors from Who Want To Be a Millionaire. Here is a description of the colors: 

* #081525: Will be the background color of the website. It has a dark blue tone to it, illustrating the misterious in a quiz. 

* #164467: Is a more light blue color. It will be used for the tabs of the answers. This is to keep consistency, but still keep the tone of the page.

* #FFFFFF: The white color will be used in various places as contrast. 

* #E1A02E: The orange color is also inspired by Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. It will be used as the text color, and has a good contrast to the Dark Blue. 

* #4C6976: Is a Teal color that goes well with the other blue colours. It will be used for the scoring board and tutorial. 

I have used to contract checker on Coolors in order to make sure that the contract is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable.

#### **Changes made to color scheme**


<a></a>

#### Structure
The website structure is built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Bootstrap provides content for both CSS and JavaScript, as functionality with both is important.
As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## Wireframes
I have decided to use [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 
First I created a wireframe for mobile, as the approach is mobile first. Thereafter wireframes for desktop and tablets.
