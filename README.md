### Design Choices

<a></a>

#### Fonts
 I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options. The fonts used in this project are [Noto Serif JP] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif+JP "Google fonts: Montserrat") for the overall text and [Libre Baskerville] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville#standard-styles) for the headlines. The fonts have a light readthrough and do not come of as strong to the eye. It goes well in line with the hip and light design of the website. 

<a></a>

#### Icons
I have used icons from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). The icons fit with the corresponding features that the users of the website are to understand. The visual aspect will make it easier to make a fast intepretation of what the text is about.

#### Colors


You can view my color scheme [here](assets/images/ways-colors.png)

I have used to contract checker on Coolors in order to make sure that the contract is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable.

#### Structure
The website structure is built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Bootstrap provides content for both CSS and JavaScript, as functionality with both is important.
As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## Wireframes
I have decided to use [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 
First I created a wireframe for mobile, as the approach is mobile first. Thereafter wireframes for desktop and tablets.
